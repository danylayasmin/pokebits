# 📝 Rico - Brainstorm for Pokebits API Deepdive

### Middleware Caching

-   🚀 Implement middleware caching for all API responses to optimize performance.

### Laravel Query Builder for Filtering

-   🔍 Use laravel-query-builder to enable efficient filtering of data for API requests, enhancing searching.

### Rate Limiting by IP

-   ⏱️ Enforce rate limiting to 150 requests per minute by IP address to manage traffic and prevent abuse as a security measure.

### API Operations Support

-   ✨ Ensure API supports essential operations the front-end developers might need to use.

### OpenAPI Spec Documentation

-   📚 Utilize Laravel OpenAPI package (https://vyuldashev.github.io/laravel-openapi/#installation) to generate detailed API documentation conforming to OpenAPI Spec.

### Postman Collections for Developers

-   📦 Provide downloadable Postman collections to help developers in testing and utilizing the API.

### Database Schema

-   🗄️ Construct a clean database schema to efficiently store and manage Pokémon and types data.

### Detailed Pokémon and Types Information via API

-   🐾 Ensure the API gives detailed information on all Pokémon and their respective types, so we have comprehensive data retrieval.

### Average Pokemon Color

-   🌈 Create a way to find the average color of the Pokemon. For this we can create a helper function that uses https://image.intervention.io/v2. (I have created an average color function for a personal project before, so we can use this.)

### \*EXTRA IF TIME OVER: Simple Front-end

-   🖥️ Develop a basic front-end to explain Pokebits API functionality and usage for user-friendly interaction.

### \*EXTRA IF TIME OVER: Deploy API to a Server

-   🌐 Deploy the Pokebits API to a server for public access, making it usable for everyone.

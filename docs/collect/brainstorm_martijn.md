# Martijn Brainstorm

I believe that this project is something easy for us to do, due to our existing skillset.

## Core features:
- A database containing the data that is returned by the API
- An API that contains data relevant to the Pok√©mon universe
- Security of the data within our database
- Scalabality of the API without it causing a crash to the application
- Readable API Documentation

## Optional Features
- A way for guests to test the API
- A dashboard to review current data
- Integration with either Front-End or Data-Engineer teams

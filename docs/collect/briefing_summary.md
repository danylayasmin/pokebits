# Pokémon Data Initiative

According to the first file that was given to us, we concluded that we need to build a database that can be integrated with an API, which we also build on our own.

Further into the briefing, there are multiple personas introduced to us, with the goal to keep their wishes and needs in our mind while we develop the next big project that will shape the future of Pokémon research and training.

# Project Status Update - Day 3

🌟 **Accomplishments:**

-   🛣️ API routes are now defined
-   ✅ Functions in controllers are modified and correct
-   🔄 Caching middleware defined and used inside routes
-   🗃️ Data now present in Database
-   🆘 Helper function defined for errors
-   📋 OpenAPISpec
-   🔍 Pivot table relationships defined

🚀 **Next Steps:**

-   🧪 Test relationships
-   🔍 Filter for index functions
-   🔄 Sort for all functions

📈 **Overall Progress:**

Data is now cached and rate limited, making our application more secure. Now we can work with actual data due to it being present in the database. Readme has been updated to support the idea of future developers picking up this project and to include steps for users to use this application. General bugs that have been discovered are fixed, bugs that can still be discovered will be fixed when we stumble upon them. We have also begun integrating the helper function for errors into the controllers

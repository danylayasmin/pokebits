📈 **Overall Progress:**

The 'prototype' has now been finished, tomorrow we have a few hours left until we present our demo. Big changes will not be made tomorrow, the only thing we still want to do is make some simple pages so we can show our API actually working when using views. If this is not finished on time, we will simply show json data instead.
